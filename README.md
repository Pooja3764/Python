For Loop

As for loop can print any of the Data Structure in Python like- String “ ”, List [], Tuple (), Set {} and Dictionary []. 
Hence, here it work as a chain and runs till the last element of the DS.

Syntaxes:

a)	for i in “Hello World”:
    print(i)
    
b)	for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:
    print(i)
    
c)	for i in (11,22,33,44,55):
    print(i)
    
d)	for i in {1:”one”,2:”two”}:
    print(i)

A small Program:

             Alphabets= [A,B,C,D,E]
     for x in Alphabets:
         print(x)



2nd Method to run the loop is  = Range(start,end,step) method in for loop

Syntaxes:

a)	for i in range (10):
    print(I, end=”,”)

e)	for i in range (1,11):
    print(I, end=”,”)

f)	for i in range (1,20,2):
    print(I, end=”,”)

g)	for i in range (50,30,-1):
    print(i)

  
                                                                            ****END***
